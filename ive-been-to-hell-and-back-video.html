        <h1 class="heading-2">I&#x27;ve been to hell and back</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">‘I have been to hell and back’ is inspired by the life and the art of the french artist Louise Bourgeois.<br>‍<br>One of the main aspects of the artist’s oeuvre was therapeutic, and her use of the creative process in order to cope with life was fascinating to me. Inspired by the work of Bourgeois, the collection was formulated with the intention of creating beauty out of pain while exploring the relationship between those edges.<br>‍<br>Bourgeois was reducing the gap between her inner world and reality by “bringing to the outside what was happening on the inside”. This working method resonated with me and inspired me. It became my goal in the process of making this collection. I decided to put my own intimate and personal experiences of pain, struggle, and happiness into this collection. I was always attracted to the image and perception of the “perfect woman”. I aim to explore these concepts by working around glamorized garment references from different periods, and by bringing crafty and emotional elements together with my visual world.<br>‍<br>For each look of the collection, I created mesh suits printed with my handwriting, as well as quotes that touched me, and even pieces of my personal diaries. The different skin tones represent the verity of femininity I Design For. The different tones are sampled from photos of the women in my life.<br>‍<br>For the first look, I concentrated on the most known work of Bourgeois, The Spider. It stands for femininity, for the delivery, the female blood, and the process of carrying a child, for motherhood. The spider is a representative of the mother. That leads me to the connection between femininity and needlework throughout history.<br>‍<br>For the second look, I focused on the female body. I worked with leather in a molding technique and created a corset in the shape of a female torso. The jacket is made with an appliqué of an image of my own torso with different tapestry textiles from an old sofa, which I ripped and restitched to create the jacket. The skirt shape is inspired by cage undergarments and the feminine parts of a woman&#x27;s body. The jacket restricts the hands of the wearer just as women are restricted by the ideal of beauty. <br><br>The third look was inspired by Bourgeois’s studio. She used to communicate with herself in a therapeutic way by hanging notes all over her studio’s walls. When reading about it I noticed that I do the same in my own workspace. I took pictures of the walls of my apartment and from that developed a print for a suit.<br>‍<br>The last look is inspired by the relationship between the man and the woman in Bourgeois’s work. For that, I was mainly inspired by the performance – ‘SHE LOST IT’. It shows a painful text about a woman who is locked in a relationship. The woman is waiting for a man, and in the process, she becomes smaller and smaller. This metaphor touched me and I could relate to it from my own past experiences. I decided to work with a number of leathers that reminded me of a human skin tone to create a dress that captured the wearer inside it, she is trapped in beauty again. I developed 3D models in the shape of hands, inspired by several of Bourgeois’s sculptures in similar shapes, connected to each other. These 3D models form a dress that is also a piece of jewelry.</p>
