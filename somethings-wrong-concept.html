        <p class="paragraph">The collection embodies various questions I’m exploring as a female designer &amp; creator regarding the female experience: the physical &amp; mental space we occupy in the world (yet aim not to), fear, anger, passivity vs. movement - and the gap between beauty and pain. It explores femininity, while also observing haute couture in different cultures. It’s my own personal feminine experience, my perspective as a female creator and a designer.<br><br>My point of departure was a photography series made by the artist Chen Cohen (’How to die beautiful’, 2021). In the series, Cohen photographed herself lying on her bed. My main research motivation was to explore the idea of the bed as a symbol of death and desire, together with the passivity as a way of acting.<br><br>I decided to question various themes surrounding femininity and space. I researched for more works by female artists and gathered theory articles written by feminist writers and artists. While going through different artistic disciplines and philosophies, I came to the conclusion that all of us, from prominent known artists such as Marina Abramovic or Rebecca Horn - to my close circle of female creators, are all seeking the same goals: to exist, to be heard, to be taken seriously. And so do I.<br><br>In this collection, I also decided to question the term “haute couture”, as I’ve been always fascinated by the relationship between needlework and femininity in different decades and cultures. I studied the history of textile-making and needlework in the middle east (where I am from). As an Israeli-Jewish woman I was fascinated to encounter the heritage of Palestinian needlework techniques, and my collection also reflects upon this beautiful tradition. From my point of view, haute couture is no longer a term to describe western craftsmanship and quality made by order garments, it can relate to different cultures and garment making techniques. Each look in the collection embodies a different backstory.<br><br>As I started to develop the concept, I created a dialog with different women around me and tried to create a map of certain movements, feelings, and emotional content we all share. Texts are a strong part of my work; the walls of my apartment were covered with different texts and thoughts I wrote while creating, also poetry and quotes, which eventually became a print for some of the silhouettes.<br><br>It was important for me to be emotionally connected and invested in the process. It was a way for me to express the pain of femininity which we all carry with us over the years, crossing generations and the heritage of our mothers and grandmothers, which runs in our blood. We are born carrying it.</p>
